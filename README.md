### Post homework Takeaway:
### I think express is interesting to use, albeit frustrating to understand. Probably the biggest thing I learned while using 
### express this week and working on homework was figuring out how to use jquery to communicate with the router and on the server.

### One of the more frusturating parts was initially trying to get my app.get to work, ultimately it was my file paths that were the 
### problem, and took me too dang long to troubleshoot, but I was able to figure it out. 

### Honestly, my biggest downfall this week with homework was not having enough time outside of class and work to actually be able to work on the homework. Next week should be better, and I should be able to dedicate more time to my classwork.
